NNI 中的 PBTTuner

## PBTTuner

Population Based Training (PBT，基于种群的训练) 来自于 [Population Based Training of Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.09846v1)。 它是一种简单的异步优化算法，在固定的计算资源下，它能有效的联合优化一组模型及其超参来最大化性能。 重要的是，PBT 探索的是超参设置的规划，而不是通过整个训练过程中，来试图找到某个固定的参数配置。

PBTTuner initializes a population with several trials (i.e., `population_size`). There are four steps in the above figure, each trial only runs by one step. How long is one step is controlled by trial code, e.g., one epoch. When a trial starts, it loads a checkpoint specified by PBTTuner and continues to run one step, then saves checkpoint to a directory specified by PBTTuner and exits. The trials in a population run steps synchronously, that is, after all the trials finish the `i`-th step, the `(i+1)`-th step can be started. Exploitation and exploration of PBT are executed between two consecutive steps.

### Provide checkpoint directory

Since some trials need to load other trial's checkpoint, users should provide a directory (i.e., `all_checkpoint_dir`) which is accessible by every trial. It is easy for local mode, users could directly use the default directory or specify any directory on the local machine. For other training services, users should follow [the document of those training services](../TrainingService/SupportTrainingService.md) to provide a directory in a shared storage, such as NFS, Azure storage.

### Modify your trial code

Before running a step, a trial needs to load a checkpoint, the checkpoint directory is specified in hyper-parameter configuration generated by PBTTuner, i.e., `params['load_checkpoint_dir']`. Similarly, the directory for saving checkpoint is also included in the configuration, i.e., `params['save_checkpoint_dir']`. Here, `all_checkpoint_dir` is base folder of `load_checkpoint_dir` and `save_checkpoint_dir` whose format is `all_checkpoint_dir/<population-id>/<step>`.

```python
params = nni.get_next_parameter()
# the path of the checkpoint to load
load_path = os.path.join(params['load_checkpoint_dir'], 'model.pth')
# load checkpoint from `load_path`
...
# run one step
...
# the path for saving a checkpoint
save_path = os.path.join(params['save_checkpoint_dir'], 'model.pth')
# save checkpoint to `save_path`
...
```

### Experiment config

Below is an exmaple of PBTTuner configuration in experiment config file. **Note that Assessor is not allowed if PBTTuner is used.**

```yaml
# config.yml
tuner:
  builtinTunerName: PBTTuner
  classArgs:
    optimize_mode: maximize
    all_checkpoint_dir: /the/path/to/store/checkpoints
    population_size: 10
```

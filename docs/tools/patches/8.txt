#. A **Kubernetes** cluster using Kubernetes 1.8 or later. Follow this `guideline <https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/>`__ to set up Kubernetes
#. Prepare a **kubeconfig** file, which will be used by NNI to interact with your Kubernetes API server. By default, NNI manager will use $(HOME)/.kube/config as kubeconfig file's path. You can also specify other kubeconfig files by setting the** KUBECONFIG** environment variable. Refer this `guideline <https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/organize-cluster-access-kubeconfig>`__ to learn more about kubeconfig.
#. If your NNI trial job needs GPU resource, you should follow this `guideline <https://github.com/NVIDIA/k8s-device-plugin>`__ to configure **Nvidia device plugin for Kubernetes**.
#. Prepare a **NFS server** and export a general purpose mount (we recommend to map your NFS server path in ``root_squash option``\ , otherwise permission issue may raise when NNI copies files to NFS. Refer this `page <https://linux.die.net/man/5/exports>`__ to learn what root_squash option is), or** Azure File Storage**.
#. 
   Install **NFS client** on the machine where you install NNI and run nnictl to create experiment. Run this command to install NFSv4 client:

   .. code-block:: bash

       apt-get install nfs-common

#. 
   Install **NNI**\ , follow the install guide `here <../Tutorial/QuickStart>`__.

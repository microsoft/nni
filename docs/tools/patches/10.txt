An SSH server needs a port; you need to expose Docker's SSH port to NNI as the connection port. For example, if you set your container's SSH port as  **``A``** \ , you should map the container's port ** ``A``**  to your remote host machine's other port ** ``B``** \ , NNI will connect port ** ``B``**  as an SSH port, and your host machine will map the connection from port ** ``B``**  to port ** ``A``**  then NNI could connect to your Docker container.

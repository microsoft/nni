# NNI Overview

NNI (Neural Network Intelligence) is a toolkit to help users run automated machine learning experiments. 
The tool dispatches and runs trial jobs that generated by tuning algorithms to search the best neural architecture and/or hyper-parameters in different environments (e.g. local machine, remote servers and cloud).

## Key Concepts

### **Trial**
A **Trial** in NNI is an individual attempt at applying a set of parameters on a model. 

### **Tuner**
A **Tuner** in NNI is an implementation of Tuner API for a special tuning algorithm.

Current supported Tuner list:
 - TPE
 - Random Search
 - Anneal
 - Naive Evolution
 - SMAC (to install through `nnictl`)
 - ENAS (under development, coming soon)
 - Batch (under development, coming soon)

[Read more about the Tuners supported in the latest NNI release](../src/sdk/pynni/nni/README.md)

### **Assessor**
A **Assessor** in NNI is an implementation of Assessor API for optimizing the execution of experiment.

### **Experiment**
A **Experiment** in NNI is a method for testing different assumptions (hypotheses) by Trials under conditions constructed and controlled by NNI. During the experiment, one or more conditions are allowed to change in an organized manner and effects of these changes on associated conditions.

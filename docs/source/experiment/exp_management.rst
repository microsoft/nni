Experiment Management
=====================

An experiment can be created with command line tool ``nnictl`` or python APIs. NNI provides both command line tool ``nnictl`` and web Portal to manage the experiments, such as, creating, stopping, resuming, deleting, ranking, and comparing the experiments.

Management with ``nnictl``
--------------------------

The ability of ``nnictl`` on experiment management is almost equivalent to :doc:`./webui`. Users can refer to :doc:`../reference/nnictl` for detailed usage. It is highly suggested when visualization is not well supported in your environment (e.g., no GUI on your machine).

Management with web portal
--------------------------

Experiment management on web potral gives an quick overview of all the experiment on users' machine. Users can easily switch to one experiment from this page. Users can refer to the :doc:`./webui` page for details. The experiment management on web portal is still under intensive development to bring more user-friendly features.

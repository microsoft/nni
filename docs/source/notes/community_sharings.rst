Use Cases and Solutions
=======================

Different from the tutorials and examples in the rest of the document which show the usage of a feature, this part mainly introduces end-to-end scenarios and use cases to help users further understand how NNI can help them. NNI can be widely adopted in various scenarios. We also encourage community contributors to share their AutoML practices especially the NNI usage practices from their experience.

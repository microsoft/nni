"An AutoML experiment requires many trials to explore feasible and "

" tuning process easily scalable in a distributed platforms. It provides a"
" unified user experience for diverse computation resources (e.g., local "
"machine, remote servers, AKS). Currently, NNI supports **more than 9** "

"power to aggregate and compare tuning results from multiple experiments, "
"so that the tuning workflow becomes clean and organized."

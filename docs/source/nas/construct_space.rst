Construct Model Space
=====================

NNI provides powerful (and multi-level) APIs for users to easily express model space (or search space).

* *Mutation Primitives*: high-level APIs (e.g., ValueChoice, LayerChoice) that are utilities to build blocks in search space. In most cases, mutation pritimives should be straightforward yet expressive enough. **We strongly recommend users to try them first,** and report issues if those APIs are not satisfying.
* *Hyper-module Library*: plug-and-play modules that are proved useful. They are usually well studied in research, and comes with pre-searched results. (For example, the optimal activation function in `AutoActivation <https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.05941>`__ is reported to be `Swish <https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.SiLU.html>`__).
* *Mutator*: for advanced users only. NNI provides interface to customize new mutators for expressing more complicated model spaces.

The following table summarizes all the APIs we have provided for constructing search space.


The following APIs are provided to ease the engineering effort of writing a new search space.

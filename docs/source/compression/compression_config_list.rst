Compression Config Specification
================================

Common Keys in Config
---------------------

op_types
^^^^^^^^

A list of type names of classes that inherit from ``torch.nn.Module``.
Only module types in this list can be selected to be compressed.
If this key is not set, all module types can be selected.
If neither ``op_names`` or ``op_names_re`` are set, all modules satisfied the ``op_types`` are selected.

op_names
^^^^^^^^

A list of fully-qualified name of modules (e.g., ``['backbone.layers.0.ffn', ...]``) that will be compressed.
If the name referenced module is not existed in the model, it will be ignored.

op_names_re
^^^^^^^^^^^

A list of regular expressions for matching module names by python standard library ``re``.
The matched modules will be selected to be compressed.

exclude_op_types
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A list of type names of classes that inherit from ``torch.nn.Module``.
The module types in this list are excluded from compression.

exclude_op_names
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A list of fully-qualified name of modules that are excluded.

exclude_op_names_re
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A list of regular expressions for matching module names.
The matched modules will be removed from the modules that need to be compressed.

target_names
^^^^^^^^^^^^

A list of legal compression target name, i.e., usually ``_input_``, ``weight``, ``bias``, ``_output_`` are support to be compressed.

Two kinds of target are supported by design, module inputs/outputs(should be a tensor), module parameters/buffers:

- Inputs/Outputs: If the module inputs or outputs is a singal tensor, directly set ``_input_`` for input and ``_output_`` for output.
  ``_input_{position_index}`` or ``_input_{arg_name}`` can be used to specify the input target,
  i.e., for a forward function ``def forward(self, x: Tensor, y: Tensor, z: Any): ...``, ``_input_0`` or ``_input_x`` can be used to specify ``x`` to be compressed,
  note that ``self`` will be ignored when counting the position index.
  Similarly, ``_output_{position_index}`` can be used to specify the output target if the output is a ``list/tuple``,
  ``_output_{dict_key}`` can be used to specify the output target if the output is a ``dict``.
- Parameters/Buffers: Directly using the attribute name to specify the target, i.e., ``weight``, ``bias``.

target_settings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A ``dict`` of target settings, the format is ``{target_name: setting}``. Target setting usually configure how to compress the target.

All other keys(except these eight common keys) in a config will seems as a shortcut of target setting key, and will apply to all targets selected in this config.
For example, consider a model has two ``Linear`` module (linear module names are ``'fc1'`` and ``'fc2'``), the following configs have same effect for pruning.

.. code-block:: python

    shorthand_config = {
        'op_types': ['Linear'],
        'sparse_ratio': 0.8
    }

    standard_config = {
        'op_names': ['fc1', 'fc2'],
        'target_names': ['weight', 'bias']
        'target_settings': {
            'weight': {
                'sparse_ratio': 0.8,
                'max_sparse_ratio': None,
                'min_sparse_ratio': None,
                'sparse_threshold': None,
                'global_group_id': None,
                'dependency_group_id': None,
                'granularity': 'default',
                'internal_metric_block': None,
                'apply_method': 'mul',
            },
            'bias': {
                'align': {
                    'target_name': 'weight',
                    'dims': [0],
                },
                'apply_method': 'mul',
            }
        }
    }


.. Note:: Each compression target can only be configure once, re-configuration will not take effect.

Pruning Setting Keys
--------------------

sparse_ratio
^^^^^^^^^^^^

A float number between 0. ~ 1., the sparse ratio of the pruning target or the total sparse ratio of a group of pruning targets.
For example, if the sparse ratio is 0.8, and the pruning target is a Linear module weight, 80% weight value will be masked after pruning.

max_sparse_ratio
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A float number between 0. ~ 1., for each single pruning target, the sparse ratio after pruning will not be larger than this number,
that means at most masked ``max_sparse_ratio`` pruning target value.

min_sparse_ratio
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A float number between 0. ~ 1., for each single pruning target, the sparse ratio after pruning will not be lower than this number,
that means at least masked ``min_sparse_ratio`` pruning target value.

sparse_threshold
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A float number, different from the ``sparse_ratio`` which configures a specific sparsity, ``sparse_threshold`` usually used in some adaptive sparse cases.
``sparse_threshold`` is directly compared to pruning metrics (different in different algorithms) and the positions smaller than the threshold are masked.

The value range is different for different pruning algorithms, please reference the pruner document to see how to configure it.
In general, the higher the threshold, the higher the final sparsity. 

global_group_id
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``global_group_id`` should jointly used with ``sparse_ratio``.
All pruning targets that have same ``global_group_id`` will be treat as a whole, and the ``sparse_ratio`` will be distributed across pruning targets.
That means each pruning target might have different sparse ratio after pruning, but the group sparse ratio will be the configured ``sparse_ratio``.

Note that the ``sparse_ratio`` in the same global group should be the same.

For example, a model has three ``Linear`` modules (``'fc1'``, ``'fc2'``, ``'fc3'``),
and the expected total sparse ratio of these three modules is 0.5, then the config can be:

.. code-block:: python

    config = {
        'op_names': ['fc1', 'fc2', 'fc3'],
        'sparse_ratio': 0.5,
        'global_group_id': 'linear_group_1'
    }


dependency_group_id
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

All pruning targets that have same ``dependency_group_id`` will be treat as a whole, and the positions the targets' pruned will be the same.
For example, layer A and layer B have same ``dependency_group_id``, and they want to be pruned output channels, then A and B will be pruned the same channel indexes.

Note that the ``sparse_ratio`` in the same dependency group should be the same, and the prunable positions (after reduction by ``granularity``) should be same,
for example, pruning targets should have same output channel number when pruning output channel.

This key usually be used on modules with add operation, i.e., skip connection.

granularity
^^^^^^^^^^^

Control the granularity of the generated masked.

``default``, ``in_channel``, ``out_channel``, ``per_channel`` and list of integer are supported:

- default: The pruner will auto determine using which kind of granularity, usually consistent with the paper.
- in_channel: The pruner will do pruning on the weight parameters 1 dimension.
- out_channel: The pruner will do pruning on the weight parameters 0 dimension.
- per_channel: The pruner will do pruning on the input/output -1 dimension.
- list of integer: Block sparse will be applied. For example, ``[4, 4]`` will apply 4x4 block sparse on the last two dimensions of the weight parameters.

Note that ``in_channel`` or ``out_channel`` is not supported for input/output targets, please using ``per_channel`` instead.
``torch.nn.Embedding`` is special, it's output dimension on weight is 1, so if want to pruning Embedding output channel, please set ``in_channel`` for its granularity for workaround.

The following is an example for output channel pruning:

.. code-block:: python

    config = {
        'op_types': ['Conv2d'],
        'sparse_ratio': 0.5,
        'granularity': 'out_channel' # same as [1, -1, -1, -1]
    }

apply_method
^^^^^^^^^^^^

By default, ``mul``. ``mul`` and ``add`` is supported to apply mask on pruning target.

``mul`` means the pruning target will be masked by multiply a mask metrix contains 0 and 1, 0 represents masked position, 1 represents unmasked position.

``add`` means the pruning target will be masked by add a mask metrix contains -1000 and 0, -1000 represents masked position, 0 represents unmasked position.
Note that -1000 can be configured in the future. ``add`` usually be used to mask activation module such as Softmax.

Quantization Setting Keys
-------------------------

quant_dtype
^^^^^^^^^^^

By default, ``int8``. Support ``int`` and ``uint`` plus quant bits.

quant_scheme
^^^^^^^^^^^^

``affine`` or ``symmetric``. If this key is not set, the quantization scheme will be choosen by quantizer,
most quantizer will apply ``symmetric`` quantization.

granularity
^^^^^^^^^^^

Used to control the granularity of the target quantization, by default the whole tensor will use the same scale and zero point.

``per_channel`` and list of integer are supported:

- ``per_channel``: Each (ouput) channel will have their independent scales and zero points.
- list of integer: The integer list is the block size. Each block will have their independent scales and zero points.

Each sub-config in the config list is a dict, and the scope of each setting (key) is only internal to each sub-config.
If multiple sub-configs are configured for the same layer, the later ones will overwrite the previous ones.

Distillation Setting Keys
-------------------------

lambda
^^^^^^

A float number. The scale factor of the distillation loss.

link
^^^^

A teacher module name or a list of teacher module names. The student module link to.

apply_method
^^^^^^^^^^^^

``mse`` or ``kl``.

.. Note:: The following legacy config format is also supported in nni v3.0, and will deprecated in nni v3.2.

Common Keys in Config (Legacy)
------------------------------

op_types
^^^^^^^^

The type of the layers targeted by this sub-config.
If ``op_names`` is not set in this sub-config, all layers in the model that satisfy the type will be selected.
If ``op_names`` is set in this sub-config, the selected layers should satisfy both type and name.

op_names
^^^^^^^^

The name of the layers targeted by this sub-config.
If ``op_types`` is set in this sub-config, the selected layer should satisfy both type and name.

exclude
^^^^^^^

The ``exclude`` and ``sparsity`` keyword are mutually exclusive and cannot exist in the same sub-config.
If ``exclude`` is set in sub-config, the layers selected by this config will not be compressed.

Special Keys for Pruning (Legacy)
---------------------------------

op_partial_names
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This key will share with `Quantization Config` in the future.

This key is for the layers to be pruned with names that have the same sub-string. NNI will find all names in the model,
find names that contain one of ``op_partial_names``, and append them into the ``op_names``.

sparsity_per_layer
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The sparsity ratio of each selected layer.

e.g., the ``sparsity_per_layer`` is 0.8 means each selected layer will mask 80% values on the weight.
If ``layer_1`` (500 parameters) and ``layer_2`` (1000 parameters) are selected in this sub-config,
then ``layer_1`` will be masked 400 parameters and ``layer_2`` will be masked 800 parameters.

total_sparsity
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The sparsity ratio of all selected layers, means that sparsity ratio may no longer be even between layers.

e.g., the ``total_sparsity`` is 0.8 means 80% of parameters in this sub-config will be masked.
If ``layer_1`` (500 parameters) and ``layer_2`` (1000 parameters) are selected in this sub-config,
then ``layer_1`` and ``layer_2`` will be masked a total of 1200 parameters,
how these total parameters are distributed between the two layers is determined by the pruning algorithm.

sparsity
^^^^^^^^

``sparsity`` is an old config key from the pruning v1, it has the same meaning as ``sparsity_per_layer``.
You can also use ``sparsity`` right now, but it will be deprecated in the future.

max_sparsity_per_layer
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This key is usually used with ``total_sparsity``. It limits the maximum sparsity ratio of each layer.

In ``total_sparsity`` example, there are 1200 parameters that need to be masked and all parameters in ``layer_1`` may be totally masked.
To avoid this situation, ``max_sparsity_per_layer`` can be set as 0.9, this means up to 450 parameters can be masked in ``layer_1``,
and 900 parameters can be masked in ``layer_2``.

Special Keys for Quantization (Legacy)
--------------------------------------

quant_types
^^^^^^^^^^^

Currently, nni support three kind of quantization types: 'weight', 'input', 'output'.
It can be set as ``str`` or ``List[str]``.
Note that 'weight' and 'input' are always quantize together, e.g., ``['input', 'weight']``.

quant_bits
^^^^^^^^^^

Bits length of quantization, key is the quantization type set in ``quant_types``, value is the length,
eg. {'weight': 8}, when the type is int, all quantization types share same bits length.

quant_start_step
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Specific key for ``QAT Quantizer``. Disable quantization until model are run by certain number of steps,
this allows the network to enter a more stable.
State where output quantization ranges do not exclude a signiﬁcant fraction of values, default value is 0.

Examples
--------

Suppose we want to compress the following model::

    class Model(nn.Module):
        def __init__(self):
            super().__init__()
            self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(1, 32, 3, 1)
            self.conv2 = nn.Conv2d(32, 64, 3, 1)
            self.dropout1 = nn.Dropout2d(0.25)
            self.dropout2 = nn.Dropout2d(0.5)
            self.fc1 = nn.Linear(9216, 128)
            self.fc2 = nn.Linear(128, 10)

        def forward(self, x):
            ...
    
First, we need to determine where to compress, use the following config list to specify all ``Conv2d`` modules and module named ``fc1``::

    config_list = [{'op_types': ['Conv2d']}, {'op_names': ['fc1']}]

Sometimes we may need to compress all modules of a certain type, except for a few special ones.
Writing all the module names is laborious at this point, we can use ``exclude`` to quickly specify the compression target modules::

    config_list = [{
        'op_types': ['Conv2d', 'Linear']
    }, {
        'exclude': True,
        'op_names': ['fc2']
    }]

The above two config lists are equivalent to the model we want to compress, they both use ``conv1``, ``conv2``, and ``fc1`` as compression targets.

Let's take a simple pruning config list example, pruning all ``Conv2d`` modules with 50% sparsity, and pruning ``fc1`` with 80% sparsity::

    config_list = [{
        'op_types': ['Conv2d'],
        'total_sparsity': 0.5
    }, {
        'op_names': ['fc1'],
        'total_sparsity': 0.8
    }]

Then if you want to try model quantization, here is a simple config list example::

    config_list = [{
        'op_types': ['Conv2d'],
        'quant_types': ['input', 'weight'],
        'quant_bits': {'input': 8, 'weight': 8}
    }, {
        'op_names': ['fc1'],
        'quant_types': ['input', 'weight'],
        'quant_bits': {'input': 8, 'weight': 8}
    }]

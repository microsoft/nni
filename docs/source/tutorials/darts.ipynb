        "\n# Searching on DARTS search space\n\nIn this tutorial, we demonstrate how to search on the famous model space proposed in [DARTS](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.09055)_.\n\nThrough this process, you will learn:\n\n* How to use the built-in model spaces from NNI's model space hub.\n* How to use one-shot exploration strategies to explore a model space.\n* How to customize evaluators to achieve the best performance.\n\nIn the end, we get a strong-performing model on CIFAR-10 dataset, which achieves xx.xx% accuracy.\n\n.. attention::\n\n   Running this tutorial requires a GPU.\n   If you don't have one, you can set ``gpus`` in :class:`~nni.retiarii.evaluator.pytorch.Classification` to be 0,\n   but do note that it will be much slower.\n\n## Use the model space\n\nThe model space provided in DARTS originated from [NASNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.07012)_,\nwhere the full model is constructed by repeatedly stacking a single computational unit (called a **cell**).\nThere are two types of cells within a network. The first type is called *normal cell*, and the second type is called *reduction cell*.\nThe key difference between normal and reduction cell is that the reduction cell will downsample the input feature map,\nand decrease its resolution. Normal and reduction cells are stacked alternately, as shown in the following figure.\n\n<img src=\"file://../../img/nasnet_cell_stack.png\">\n\nA cell takes outputs from two previous cells as inputs and contains a collection of *nodes*.\nEach node takes two previous nodes within the same cell (or the two cell inputs),\nand applies an *operator* (e.g., convolution, or max-pooling) to each input,\nand sums the outputs of operators as the output of the node.\nThe output of cell is the concatenation of all the nodes that are never used as inputs of another node.\nWe recommend reading [NDS](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.13214.pdf)_ or [ENAS](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.03268)_ for details.\n\nWe illustrate an example of cells in the following figure.\n\n<img src=\"file://../../img/nasnet_cell.png\">\n\nThe search space proposed in DARTS paper introduced two modifications to the original space in [NASNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.07012)_.\n\nFirstly, the operator candidates have been narrowed down to seven:\n\n- Max pooling 3x3\n- Average pooling 3x3\n- Skip connect (Identity)\n- Separable convolution 3x3\n- Separable convolution 5x5\n- Dilated convolution 3x3\n- Dilated convolution 5x5\n\nSecondly, the output of cell is the concatenate of **all the nodes within the cell**.\n\nAs the search space is based on cell, once the normal and reduction cell has been fixed, we can stack them for indefinite times.\nTo save the search cost, the common practice is to reduce the number of filters (i.e., channels) and number of stacked cells\nduring the search phase, and increase them back when training the final searched architecture.\n\n<div class=\"alert alert-info\"><h4>Note</h4><p>DARTS is one of those papers that innovate both in search space and search strategy.\n   In this tutorial, we will search on **model space** provided by DARTS with **search strategy** proposed by DARTS.\n   We refer to them as *DARTS model space* (``DartsSpace``) and *DARTS strategy* (``DartsStrategy``), respectively.\n   We did NOT imply that the DARTS space and DARTS strategy has to used together.\n   You can always explore the DARTS space with another search strategy, or use your own strategy to search a different model space.</p></div>\n"

However, as CIFAR-10 dataset only has a training set of 50k images and a validation set (10k images),\nwe have to split the original training set into a training set and a validation set.\nAs we are going to use the provided by DARTS paper, the recommended train/val split is 1:1.\n\n"

Quantize BERT on Task GLUE
==========================

Here we show an effective transformer simulated quantization process that NNI team has tried, and users can use NNI to discover better process.

We use the BERT model and the trainer pipeline in the Transformers to do some experiments.
The entire quantization process can be divided into the following steps:

1. Use the BERT-base-uncased model and the trainer pipeline in the transformers to fine-tune the model on the downstream task GLUE.
   From our experience, the final performance of quantization on the finetuned model is
   better than quantization directly on the pre-trained model.
2. Use a specific quantizer to quantize the finetuned model on the GLUE.
   Here we apply QAT, LSQ and PTQ quantizers to quantize the BERT model so that 
   we can compare their performance of the quantized BERT on the GLUE.
   Among them, LSQ and QAT are quantization aware training methods, and PTQ is a post-training quantization method.

During the process of quantizing BERT:

* we use the BERT model and the trainer pipeline in the Transformers to do some experiments.
* we use int8 to quantize Linear layers in the BERT.encoder.

Experiment

Preparation
^^^^^^^^^^^

This section is mainly for fine-tuning model on the downstream task GLUE.
If you are familiar with how to finetune BERT on GLUE dataset, you can skip this section.

1. Load the tokenizer and BERT model from Huggingface transformers.
2. Create a trainer instance to fine-tune the BERT model.

.. note::

    Please set ``dev_mode`` to ``False`` to run this tutorial. Here ``dev_mode`` is ``True`` by default is for generating documents.

Quantization
^^^^^^^^^^^^
After fine-tuning the BERT model on the specific task GLUE, a specific quantizer instsance can be created
to process quantization aware training or post-training quantization with BERT on the GLUE.

The entire quantization process can be devided into the following steps:

1. Call ``build_finetuning_model`` to load or fine-tune the BERT model on a specific task GLUE
2. Call ``prepare_traced_trainer`` and set ``is_quant`` to ``True`` to create a traced trainer instance for model quantization
3. Call the TransformersEvaluator to create an evaluator instance
4. Use the defined config_list and evaluator to create a quantizer instance
5. Define ``max_steps`` or ``max_epochs``. Note that ``max_steps`` and ``max_epochs`` cannot be None at the same time.
6. Call ``quantizer.compress(max_steps, max_epochs)`` to execute the simulated quantization process

    Some weights of the model checkpoint at bert-base-uncased were not used when initializing BertForSequenceClassification: ['cls.predictions.transform.LayerNorm.bias', 'cls.predictions.bias', 'cls.predictions.transform.dense.weight', 'cls.seq_relationship.bias', 'cls.predictions.transform.dense.bias', 'cls.predictions.decoder.weight', 'cls.predictions.transform.LayerNorm.weight', 'cls.seq_relationship.weight']
    - This IS expected if you are initializing BertForSequenceClassification from the checkpoint of a model trained on another task or with another architecture (e.g. initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForPreTraining model).
    - This IS NOT expected if you are initializing BertForSequenceClassification from the checkpoint of a model that you expect to be exactly identical (initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForSequenceClassification model).
    Some weights of BertForSequenceClassification were not initialized from the model checkpoint at bert-base-uncased and are newly initialized: ['classifier.bias', 'classifier.weight']
    You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.

    Some weights of the model checkpoint at bert-base-uncased were not used when initializing BertForSequenceClassification: ['cls.predictions.transform.LayerNorm.bias', 'cls.predictions.bias', 'cls.predictions.transform.dense.weight', 'cls.seq_relationship.bias', 'cls.predictions.transform.dense.bias', 'cls.predictions.decoder.weight', 'cls.predictions.transform.LayerNorm.weight', 'cls.seq_relationship.weight']
    - This IS expected if you are initializing BertForSequenceClassification from the checkpoint of a model trained on another task or with another architecture (e.g. initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForPreTraining model).
    - This IS NOT expected if you are initializing BertForSequenceClassification from the checkpoint of a model that you expect to be exactly identical (initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForSequenceClassification model).
    Some weights of BertForSequenceClassification were not initialized from the model checkpoint at bert-base-uncased and are newly initialized: ['classifier.bias', 'classifier.weight']
    You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.

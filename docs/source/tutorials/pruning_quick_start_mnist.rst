Pruning Quickstart
==================

Model pruning is a technique to reduce the model size and computation by reducing model weight size or intermediate state size.
There are three common practices for pruning a DNN model:

#. Pre-training a model -> Pruning the model -> Fine-tuning the pruned model
#. Pruning a model during training (i.e., pruning aware training) -> Fine-tuning the pruned model
#. Pruning a model -> Training the pruned model from scratch

NNI supports all of the above pruning practices by working on the key pruning stage.
Following this tutorial for a quick look at how to use NNI to prune a model in a common practice.

Preparation
-----------

In this tutorial, we use a simple model and pre-trained on MNIST dataset.
If you are familiar with defining a model and training in pytorch, you can skip directly to `Pruning Model`_.

Pruning Model
-------------

Using L1NormPruner to prune the model and generate the masks.
Usually, a pruner requires original model and ``config_list`` as its inputs.
Detailed about how to write ``config_list`` please refer :doc:`compression config specification <../compression/compression_config_list>`.

The following `config_list` means all layers whose type is `Linear` or `Conv2d` will be pruned,
except the layer named `fc3`, because `fc3` is `exclude`.
The final sparsity ratio for each layer is 50%. The layer named `fc3` will not be pruned.

    config_list = [{
        'sparsity_per_layer': 0.5,
        'op_types': ['Linear', 'Conv2d']
    }, {
        'exclude': True,
        'op_names': ['fc3']

Speedup the original model with masks, note that `ModelSpeedup` requires an unwrapped model.
The model becomes smaller after speedup,
and reaches a higher sparsity ratio because `ModelSpeedup` will propagate the masks across layers.

Fine-tuning Compacted Model
---------------------------
Note that if the model has been sped up, you need to re-initialize a new optimizer for fine-tuning.
Because speedup will replace the masked big layers with dense small ones.

Research and Publications
=========================

We are intensively working on both tool chain and research to make automatic model design and tuning really practical and powerful. On the one hand, our main work is tool chain oriented development. On the other hand, our research works aim to improve this tool chain, rethink challenging problems in AutoML (on both system and algorithm) and propose elegant solutions. Below we list some of our research works, we encourage more research works on this topic and encourage collaboration with us.

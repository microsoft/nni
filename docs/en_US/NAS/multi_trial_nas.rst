Multi-trial NAS
===============

In multi-trial NAS, users need model evaluator to evaluate the performance of each sampled model, and need an exploration strategy to sample models from a defined model space. Here, users could use NNI provided model evaluators or write their own model evalutor. They can simply choose a exploration strategy. Advanced users can also customize new exploration strategy. For a simple example about how to run a multi-trial NAS experiment, please refer to `Quick Start <./QuickStart.rst>`__.

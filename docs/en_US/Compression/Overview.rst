Model Compression with NNI
==========================

.. contents::

As larger neural networks with more layers and nodes are considered, reducing their storage and computational cost becomes critical, especially for some real-time applications. Model compression can be used to address this problem.

NNI provides a model compression toolkit to help user compress and speed up their model with state-of-the-art compression algorithms and strategies. There are several core features supported by NNI model compression:


* Support many popular pruning and quantization algorithms.
* Automate model pruning and quantization process with state-of-the-art strategies and NNI's auto tuning power.
* Speed up a compressed model to make it have lower inference latency and also make it become smaller.
* Provide friendly and easy-to-use compression utilities for users to dive into the compression process and results.
* Concise interface for users to customize their own compression algorithms.

*Note that the interface and APIs are unified for both PyTorch and TensorFlow, currently only PyTorch version has been supported, TensorFlow version will be supported in future.*

Pruning Algorithms
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Pruning algorithms compress the original network by removing redundant weights or channels of layers, which can reduce model complexity and address the over-Ô¨Åtting issue.

Quantization Algorithms
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Quantization algorithms compress the original network by reducing the number of bits required to represent weights or activations, which can reduce the computations and the inference time.

Automatic Model Compression
---------------------------

Given targeted compression ratio, it is pretty hard to obtain the best compressed ratio in a one shot manner. An automatic model compression algorithm usually need to explore the compression space by compressing different layers with different sparsities. NNI provides such algorithms to free users from specifying sparsity of each layer in a model. Moreover, users could leverage NNI's auto tuning power to automatically compress a model. Detailed document can be found `here <./AutoPruningUsingTuners.rst>`__.

Model Speedup
-------------

The final goal of model compression is to reduce inference latency and model size. However, existing model compression algorithms mainly use simulation to check the performance (e.g., accuracy) of compressed model, for example, using masks for pruning algorithms, and storing quantized values still in float32 for quantization algorithms. Given the output masks and quantization bits produced by those algorithms, NNI can really speed up the model. The detailed tutorial of Model Speedup can be found `here <./ModelSpeedup.rst>`__.

Compression Utilities
---------------------

Compression utilities include some useful tools for users to understand and analyze the model they want to compress. For example, users could check sensitivity of each layer to pruning. Users could easily calculate the FLOPs and parameter size of a model. Please refer to `here <./CompressionUtils.rst>`__ for a complete list of compression utilities.

Customize Your Own Compression Algorithms
-----------------------------------------

NNI model compression leaves simple interface for users to customize a new compression algorithm. The design philosophy of the interface is making users focus on the compression logic while hiding framework specific implementation details from users. The detailed tutorial for customizing a new compression algorithm (pruning algorithm or quantization algorithm) can be found `here <./Framework.rst>`__.

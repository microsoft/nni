# Customize-Tuner

## Customize Tuner

NNI provides state-of-the-art tuning algorithm in builtin-tuners. NNI supports to build a tuner by yourself for tuning demand.

If you want to implement your own tuning algorithm, you can implement a customized Tuner, there are three things to do:

1. Inherit the base Tuner class
1. Implement receive_trial_result and generate_parameter function
1. Configure your customized tuner in experiment YAML config file

Here is an example:

**1. Inherit the base Tuner class**

```python
from nni.tuner import Tuner

class CustomizedTuner(Tuner):
    def __init__(self, ...):
        ...
```

**2. Implement receive_trial_result and generate_parameter function**

```python
from nni.tuner import Tuner

class CustomizedTuner(Tuner):
    def __init__(self, ...):
        ...

    def receive_trial_result(self, parameter_id, parameters, value):
    '''
    Receive trial's final result.
    parameter_id: int
    parameters: object created by 'generate_parameters()'
    value: final metrics of the trial, including default metric
    '''
    # your code implements here.
    ...

    def generate_parameters(self, parameter_id):
    '''
    Returns a set of trial (hyper-)parameters, as a serializable object
    parameter_id: int
    '''
    # your code implements here.
    return your_parameters
    ...
```

`receive_trial_result` will receive the `parameter_id, parameters, value` as parameters input. Also, Tuner will receive the `value` object are exactly same value that Trial send.

The `your_parameters` return from `generate_parameters` function, will be package as json object by NNI SDK. NNI SDK will unpack json object so the Trial will receive the exact same `your_parameters` from Tuner.

For example:
If the you implement the `generate_parameters` like this:

```python
def generate_parameters(self, parameter_id):
    '''
    Returns a set of trial (hyper-)parameters, as a serializable object
    parameter_id: int
    '''
    # your code implements here.
    return {"dropout": 0.3, "learning_rate": 0.4}

```

It means your Tuner will always generate parameters `{"dropout": 0.3, "learning_rate": 0.4}`. Then Trial will receive `{"dropout": 0.3, "learning_rate": 0.4}` by calling API `nni.get_next_parameter()`. Once the trial ends with a result (normally some kind of metrics), it can send the result to Tuner by calling API `nni.report_final_result()`, for example `nni.report_final_result(0.93)`. Then your Tuner's `receive_trial_result` function will receied the result likeï¼š

```python
parameter_id = 82347
parameters = {"dropout": 0.3, "learning_rate": 0.4}
value = 0.93
```

**Note that** if you want to access a file (e.g., `data.txt`) in the directory of your own tuner, you cannot use `open('data.txt', 'r')`. Instead, you should use the following:

```python
_pwd = os.path.dirname(__file__)
_fd = open(os.path.join(_pwd, 'data.txt'), 'r')
```

This is because your tuner is not executed in the directory of your tuner (i.e., `pwd` is not the directory of your own tuner).

**3. Configure your customized tuner in experiment YAML config file**

NNI needs to locate your customized tuner class and instantiate the class, so you need to specify the location of the customized tuner class and pass literal values as parameters to the \_\_init__ constructor.

```yaml
tuner:
  codeDir: /home/abc/mytuner
  classFileName: my_customized_tuner.py
  className: CustomizedTuner
  # Any parameter need to pass to your tuner class __init__ constructor
  # can be specified in this optional classArgs field, for example
  classArgs:
    arg1: value1

```

### Write a more advanced automl algorithm

The methods above are usually enough to write a general tuner. However, users may also want more methods, for example, intermediate results, trials' state (e.g., the methods in assessor), in order to have a more powerful automl algorithm. Therefore, we have another concept called `advisor` which directly inherits from `MsgDispatcherBase` in [`src/sdk/pynni/nni/msg_dispatcher_base.py`](https://github.com/Microsoft/nni/tree/master/src/sdk/pynni/nni/msg_dispatcher_base.py). Please refer to [here](CustomizeAdvisor.md) for how to write a customized advisor.

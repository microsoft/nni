# Run an Experiment on Remote Machines

NNI can run one experiment on multiple remote machines through SSH, called `remote` mode. It's like a lightweight training platform. In this mode, NNI can be started from your computer, and dispatch trials to remote machines in parallel.

## Remote machine requirements

* It only supports Linux as remote machines, and [linux part in system specification](../Tutorial/Installation.md) is same as NNI local mode.

* Follow [installation](../Tutorial/Installation.md) to install NNI on each machine.

* Make sure remote machines meet environment requirements of your trial code. If the default environment does not meet the requirements, the setup script can be added into `command` field of NNI config.

* Make sure remote machines can be accessed through SSH from the machine which runs `nnictl` command. It supports both password and key authentication of SSH. For advanced usages, please refer to [machineList part of configuration](../Tutorial/ExperimentConfig.md).

* Make sure the NNI version on each machine is consistent.

## Run an experiment

e.g. there are three machines, which can be logged in with username and password.

| IP       | Username | Password |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| 10.1.1.1 | bob      | bob123   |
| 10.1.1.2 | bob      | bob123   |
| 10.1.1.3 | bob      | bob123   |

Install and run NNI on one of those three machines or another machine, which has network access to them.

Use `examples/trials/mnist-annotation` as the example. Below is content of `examples/trials/mnist-annotation/config_remote.yml`:

```yaml
authorName: default
experimentName: example_mnist
trialConcurrency: 1
maxExecDuration: 1h
maxTrialNum: 10
#choice: local, remote, pai
trainingServicePlatform: remote
# search space file
searchSpacePath: search_space.json
#choice: true, false
useAnnotation: true
tuner:
  #choice: TPE, Random, Anneal, Evolution, BatchTuner
  #SMAC (SMAC should be installed through nnictl)
  builtinTunerName: TPE
  classArgs:
    #choice: maximize, minimize
    optimize_mode: maximize
trial:
  command: python3 mnist.py
  codeDir: .
  gpuNum: 0
#machineList can be empty if the platform is local
machineList:
  - ip: 10.1.1.1
    username: bob
    passwd: bob123
    #port can be skip if using default ssh port 22
    #port: 22
  - ip: 10.1.1.2
    username: bob
    passwd: bob123
  - ip: 10.1.1.3
    username: bob
    passwd: bob123
```

Files in `codeDir` will be uploaded to remote machines automatically. You can run below command on Windows, Linux, or macOS to spawn trials on remote Linux machines:

```bash
nnictl create --config examples/trials/mnist-annotation/config_remote.yml
```

## "Hello World" example on MNIST

NNI is a toolkit to help users run automated machine learning experiments. It can automatically do the cyclic process of getting hyperparameters, running trials, testing results, tuning hyperparameters. Now, we show how to use NNI to help you find the optimal hyperparameters.

Here is an example script to train a CNN on MNIST dataset **without NNI**:

```python
def run_trial(params):
    # Input data
    mnist = input_data.read_data_sets(params['data_dir'], one_hot=True)
    # Build network
    mnist_network = MnistNetwork(channel_1_num=params['channel_1_num'], channel_2_num=params['channel_2_num'], conv_size=params['conv_size'], hidden_size=params['hidden_size'], pool_size=params['pool_size'], learning_rate=params['learning_rate'])
    mnist_network.build_network()

    test_acc = 0.0
    with tf.Session() as sess:
        # Train network
        mnist_network.train(sess, mnist)
        # Evaluate network
        test_acc = mnist_network.evaluate(mnist)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    params = {'data_dir': '/tmp/tensorflow/mnist/input_data', 'dropout_rate': 0.5, 'channel_1_num': 32, 'channel_2_num': 64, 'conv_size': 5, 'pool_size': 2, 'hidden_size': 1024, 'learning_rate': 1e-4, 'batch_num': 2000, 'batch_size': 32}
    run_trial(params)
```

Note: If you want to see the full implementation, please refer to [examples/trials/mnist/mnist_before.py](https://github.com/Microsoft/nni/tree/master/examples/trials/mnist/mnist_before.py)

The above code can only try one set of parameters at a time, if we want to tune learning rate, we need to manually modify the hyperparameter and start the trial again and again.

NNI is born for helping user do the tuning jobs, the NNI working process is presented below:

```pseudo
input: search space, trial code, config file
output: one optimal hyperparameter configuration

1: For t = 0, 1, 2, ..., maxTrialNum,
2:      hyperparameter = chose a set of parameter from search space
3:      final result = run_trial_and_evaluate(hyperparameter)
4:      report final result to NNI
5:      If reach the upper limit time,
6:          Stop the experiment
7: return hyperparameter value with best final result
```

If you want to use NNI to automatically train your model and find the optimal hyper-parameters, you need to do three changes base on your code:

**Three things required to do when using NNI**

**Step 1**: Give a `Search Space` file in JSON, includes the `name` and the `distribution` (discrete valued or continuous valued) of all the hyperparameters you need to search.

```diff
-   params = {'data_dir': '/tmp/tensorflow/mnist/input_data', 'dropout_rate': 0.5, 'channel_1_num': 32, 'channel_2_num': 64,
-   'conv_size': 5, 'pool_size': 2, 'hidden_size': 1024, 'learning_rate': 1e-4, 'batch_num': 2000, 'batch_size': 32}
+ {
+     "dropout_rate":{"_type":"uniform","_value":[0.5, 0.9]},
+     "conv_size":{"_type":"choice","_value":[2,3,5,7]},
+     "hidden_size":{"_type":"choice","_value":[124, 512, 1024]},
+     "batch_size": {"_type":"choice", "_value": [1, 4, 8, 16, 32]},
+     "learning_rate":{"_type":"choice","_value":[0.0001, 0.001, 0.01, 0.1]}
+ }
```

*Implemented code directory: [search_space.json](https://github.com/Microsoft/nni/tree/master/examples/trials/mnist/search_space.json)*

**Step 2**: Modified your `Trial` file to get the hyperparameter set from NNI and report the final result to NNI.

```diff
+ import nni

  def run_trial(params):
      mnist = input_data.read_data_sets(params['data_dir'], one_hot=True)

      mnist_network = MnistNetwork(channel_1_num=params['channel_1_num'], channel_2_num=params['channel_2_num'], conv_size=params['conv_size'], hidden_size=params['hidden_size'], pool_size=params['pool_size'], learning_rate=params['learning_rate'])
      mnist_network.build_network()

      with tf.Session() as sess:
          mnist_network.train(sess, mnist)
          test_acc = mnist_network.evaluate(mnist)
+         nni.report_final_result(acc)

  if __name__ == '__main__':
-     params = {'data_dir': '/tmp/tensorflow/mnist/input_data', 'dropout_rate': 0.5, 'channel_1_num': 32, 'channel_2_num': 64,
-     'conv_size': 5, 'pool_size': 2, 'hidden_size': 1024, 'learning_rate': 1e-4, 'batch_num': 2000, 'batch_size': 32}
+     params = nni.get_next_parameter()
      run_trial(params)
```

*Implemented code directory: [mnist.py](https://github.com/Microsoft/nni/tree/master/examples/trials/mnist/mnist.py)*

**Step 3**: Define a `config` file in YAML, which declare the `path` to search space and trial, also give `other information` such as tuning algorithm, max trial number and max duration arguments.

```yaml
authorName: default
experimentName: example_mnist
trialConcurrency: 1
maxExecDuration: 1h
maxTrialNum: 10
trainingServicePlatform: local
# The path to Search Space
searchSpacePath: search_space.json
useAnnotation: false
tuner:
  builtinTunerName: TPE
# The path and the running command of trial
trial:  
  command: python3 mnist.py
  codeDir: .
  gpuNum: 0
```

Note, **for Windows, you need to change trial command `python3` to `python`**

*Implemented code directory: [config.yml](https://github.com/Microsoft/nni/tree/master/examples/trials/mnist/config.yml)*

All the codes above are already prepared and stored in [examples/trials/mnist/](https://github.com/Microsoft/nni/tree/master/examples/trials/mnist).

#### Linux and MacOS   
Run the **config.yml** file from your command line to start MNIST experiment.

```bash
    nnictl create --config nni/examples/trials/mnist/config.yml
```
#### Windows   
Run the **config_windows.yml** file from your command line to start MNIST experiment.

**Note**, if you're using NNI on Windows, it needs to change `python3` to `python` in the config.yml file, or use the config_windows.yml file to start the experiment.

```bash
    nnictl create --config nni\examples\trials\mnist\config_windows.yml
```

Note, **nnictl** is a command line tool, which can be used to control experiments, such as start/stop/resume an experiment, start/stop NNIBoard, etc. Click [here](Nnictl.md) for more usage of `nnictl`

Wait for the message `INFO: Successfully started experiment!` in the command line. This message indicates that your experiment has been successfully started. And this is what we expected to get:

```text
INFO: Starting restful server...
INFO: Successfully started Restful server!
INFO: Setting local config...
INFO: Successfully set local config!
INFO: Starting experiment...
INFO: Successfully started experiment!
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
The experiment id is egchD4qy
The Web UI urls are: [Your IP]:8080
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

You can use these commands to get more information about the experiment
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
         commands                       description
1. nnictl experiment show        show the information of experiments
2. nnictl trial ls               list all of trial jobs
3. nnictl top                    monitor the status of running experiments
4. nnictl log stderr             show stderr log content
5. nnictl log stdout             show stdout log content
6. nnictl stop                   stop an experiment
7. nnictl trial kill             kill a trial job by id
8. nnictl --help                 get help information about nnictl
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
```

If you prepare `trial`, `search space` and `config` according to the above steps and successfully create a NNI job, NNI will automatically tune the optimal hyper-parameters and run different hyper-parameters sets for each trial according to the requirements you set. You can clearly sees its progress by NNI WebUI.

## WebUI

After you start your experiment in NNI successfully, you can find a message in the command-line interface to tell you `Web UI url` like this:

```text
The Web UI urls are: [Your IP]:8080
```

Open the `Web UI url`(In this information is: `[Your IP]:8080`) in your browser, you can view detail information of the experiment and all the submitted trial jobs as shown below. If you can not open the WebUI link in your terminal, you can refer to [FAQ](FAQ.md).

#### View summary page

Click the tab "Overview".

## TPE

The Tree-structured Parzen Estimator (TPE) is a sequential model-based optimization (SMBO) approach. SMBO methods sequentially construct models to approximate the performance of hyperparameters based on historical measurements, and then subsequently choose new hyperparameters to test based on this model. The TPE approach models P(x|y) and P(y) where x represents hyperparameters and y the associated evaluate matric. P(x|y) is modeled by transforming the generative process of hyperparameters, replacing the distributions of the configuration prior with non-parametric densities. This optimization approach is described in detail in [Algorithms for Hyper-Parameter Optimization](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/4443-algorithms-for-hyper-parameter-optimization.pdf). â€‹

## Random Search

In [Random Search for Hyper-Parameter Optimization](http://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume13/bergstra12a/bergstra12a.pdf) show that Random Search might be surprisingly simple and effective. We suggests that we could use Random Search as baseline when we have no knowledge about the prior distribution of hyper-parameters.

## Anneal

This simple annealing algorithm begins by sampling from the prior, but tends over time to sample from points closer and closer to the best ones observed. This algorithm is a simple variation on random search that leverages smoothness in the response surface. The annealing rate is not adaptive.

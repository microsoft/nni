From September 2018 to September 2019, We are still moving on â€¦

 **Great news!**\ &nbsp;&nbsp;With the tag of **Scalability** and **Ease of Use**\ , NNI v1.0 is comming. Based on the various types of `Tuning Algorithms <./Tuner/BuiltinTuner.md>`_\ , NNI has supported the Hyperparameter tuning, Neural Architecture search and Auto-Feature-Engineering, which is an exciting news for algorithmic engineers; besides these, NNI v1.0 has made many improvements in the optimization of tuning algorithm, `WebUI's simplicity and intuition <./Tutorial/WebUI.md>`_ and `Platform diversification <./TrainingService/SupportTrainingService.md>`_. NNI has grown into a more intelligent automated machine learning (AutoML) toolkit.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\ **Step one**\ : Start with the `Tutorial Doc <./Tutorial/Installation.md>`_\ , and install NNI v1.0 first.\ :raw-html-m2r:`<br>`
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\ **Step two**\ : Find a " Hello world example", follow the `Tutorial Doc <./Tutorial/QuickStart.md>`_ and have a Quick Start. :raw-html-m2r:`<br>`
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\ **Step three**\ : Get familiar with the `WebUI Tutorial <./Tutorial/WebUI.md>`_ and let NNI better assists with your tuning tour.\ :raw-html-m2r:`<br>`

The fully automated tool greatly improves the efficiency of the tuning process. For more detail about the 1.0 updates, you can refer to `Release 1.0 <https://github.com/microsoft/nni/releases>`_. More of our advance plan, you can refer to our `Roadmap <https://github.com/microsoft/nni/wiki/Roadmap>`_. Besides, we also welcome more and more contributors to join us, there are many ways to participate, please refer to `How to contribute <./Tutorial/Contributing.md>`_ for more details.

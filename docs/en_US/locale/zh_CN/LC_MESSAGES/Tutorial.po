"To improve user experience and reduce user effort, we design an "
"annotation grammar. Using NNI annotation, users can adapt their code to "
"NNI just by adding some standalone annotating strings, which does not "
"affect the execution of the original code."

"The meaning of this example is that NNI will choose one of several values"
" (0.1, 0.01, 0.001) to assign to the learning_rate variable. "
"Specifically, this first line is an NNI annotation, which is a single "
"string. Following is an assignment statement. What nni does here is to "
"replace the right value of this assignment statement according to the "
"information provided by the annotation line."

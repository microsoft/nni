# NNI on Windows (experimental feature)

Currently we support local, remote and pai mode on Windows. Windows 10.1809 is well tested and recommended.

## **Installation on Windows**

  please refer to [Installation](Installation.md) for more details.

When these things are done, use the **config_windows.yml** configuration to start an experiment for validation.

```bash
nnictl create --config nni\examples\trials\mnist\config_windows.yml
```

For other examples you need to change trial command `python3` into `python` in each example YAML.

## **FAQ**

### simplejson failed when installing NNI

Make sure C++ 14.0 compiler installed.
>building 'simplejson._speedups' extension error: [WinError 3] The system cannot find the path specified

### Trial failed with missing DLL in command line or PowerShell

This error caused by missing LIBIFCOREMD.DLL and LIBMMD.DLL and fail to install SciPy. Using Anaconda or Miniconda with Python(64-bit) can solve it.
>ImportError: DLL load failed

### Trial failed on webUI

Please check the trial log file stderr for more details.

If there is a stderr file, please check out. Two possible cases are as follows:

* forget to change the trial command `python3` into `python` in each experiment YAML.
* forget to install experiment dependencies such as TensorFlow, Keras and so on.

### Fail to use BOHB on Windows
Make sure C++ 14.0 compiler installed then try to run `nnictl package install --name=BOHB` to install the dependencies.

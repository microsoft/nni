**Set up NNI developer environment**

## Best practice for debug NNI source code

For debugging NNI source code, your development environment should be under Ubuntu 16.04 (or above) system with python 3 and pip 3 installed, then follow the below steps.

**1. Clone the source code**

Run the command

```
git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/nni.git
```

to clone the source code

**2. Prepare the debug environment and install dependencies**

Change directory to the source code folder, then run the command

```
make install-dependencies
```

to install the dependent tools for the environment

**3. Build source code**

Run the command

```
make build
```

to build the source code

**4. Install NNI to development environment**

Run the command

```
make dev-install
```

to install the distribution content to development environment, and create cli scripts

**5. Check if the environment is ready**

Now, you can try to start an experiment to check if your environment is ready.
For example, run the command

```
nnictl create --config ~/nni/examples/trials/mnist-tfv1/config.yml
```

And open WebUI to check if everything is OK

**6. Redeploy**

After the code changes, use **step 3** to rebuild your codes, then the changes will take effect immediately.

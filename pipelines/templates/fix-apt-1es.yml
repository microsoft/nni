# Fix apt-related issues on 1ES linux pipeline.

# 1ES has an auto-upgraded with apt-get running in the background, periodically.
# This leads to bad consequences:
# 1) apt is locked when install is actually needed
# 2) unattended upgrade could possibly break the GPU driver version, and crash nvidia-smi.
#
# The ultimate solution should be to upgrade the VM image correctly,
# but it's currently infeasible because of a resource group limitation.
# We introduce a workaround here by force disabling the auto-upgrade and,
# fix the broken dependencies if upgrade has already been accidentally run.
#
# This file can be removed after image is updated to latest.

# Make sure GPU isn't broken.
# Sometimes we can't save the GPU because upgrade runs too early.
# We have to rerun the pipeline if unlucky. But it doesn't matter if we don't intend to use GPU at all.

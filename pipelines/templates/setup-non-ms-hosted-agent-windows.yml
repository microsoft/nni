# Install python.
# Originally I tried to install the python by downloading from official, and run the installation.
#
#     Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.9.12/python-3.9.12-amd64.exe" -OutFile "python-installer.exe"
#     Start-Process -FilePath .\python-installer.exe -NoNewWindow -Wait \
#       -ArgumentList "/quiet InstallAllUsers=1 TargetDir=$(Agent.ToolsDirectory)\Python\3.9.12\x64 Include_launcher=0"
#     New-Item -Path $(Agent.ToolsDirectory)\Python\3.9.12\x64.complete -ItemType file -Force
#
# But ``Start-Process`` fails with mysterious reasons (exit code is not zero and no error message).
# I tried with -PassThru, -NoNewWindow, -Wait, /quiet, /passive, InstallAllUsers and some other flags, but none works.
# (InstallAllUsers is the key to make it work on my local, but not on pipeline).
# I guess it's related to lack of adminstrative privileges.
# I kept this attempt here in case any one can make it work.
#
# Other two workarounds.
# 1) choco install python. The community verison can't customize output directory,
#    and the output directory is only a guess (e.g., C:\Python310).
# 2) nuget install python. This seems working.
#
# Can't move to the installed python to $PythonDir\3.9.12\x64 because,
# 1. If we copy it, Python path will complain in the next few steps.
# 2. If we try to create a symlink, it will tell us that we don't have adminstrative rights.
#
# After all this struggle, the workaround here is simple:
# to install with nuget, then don't use `UsePythonVersion` in the next step.
# The workaround works because we actually never needs multiple python versions on windows.

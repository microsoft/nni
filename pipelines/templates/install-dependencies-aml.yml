# Need to have a service principal (SP) to login to Azure services (e.g., AzureML).
# Refer to external account section in OneNote for how to generate / renew the authorization.
# According to docs, the secrets need to be refreshed at least once per year.
# After the tokens are updated, pipeline secret varibles should be updated correspondingly.

    az login --service-principal -u $(client_id) -p $(client_secret) --tenant $(tenant_id)

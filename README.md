# Neural Network Intelligence

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Microsoft/nni.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Microsoft/nni)

NNI (Neural Network Intelligence) is a toolkit to help users run automated machine learning experiments. 
The tool dispatches and runs trial jobs that generated by tuning algorithms to search the best neural architecture and/or hyper-parameters in different environments (e.g. local machine, remote servers and cloud).

## **Who should consider using NNI**
1. You want to try different AutoML algorithms for your training code (model) at local
2. You want to run AutoML trial jobs in different environments to speed up search (e.g. remote servers and cloud)
3. As a researcher or a data scientist, you want to implement your own AutoML algorithm and compare it with other algorithms
4. As a ML platform owner, you want to provide AutoML support on the platform

## **Install & Verify**

**pip install** 
* We only support Linux in current stage, Ubuntu 16.04 or higher are tested and supported. Simply run the following `pip install` in an environment that has `python >= 3.5`, `git` and `wget`.
```
python3 -m pip install -v --user git+https://github.com/Microsoft/nni.git@v0.2
source ~/.bashrc
```

**verify install**
* The following example is an experiment built on TensorFlow, make sure you have `TensorFlow installed` before running it.
```bash
    nnictl create --config ~/nni/examples/trials/mnist/config.yml
```

* In the command terminal, waiting for the message `Info: Start experiment success!` which indicates your experiment had been successfully started. You are able to explore the experiment using the `Web UI url`.
```diff
    Info: Checking experiment...
    ...
    Info: Starting experiment...
    Info: Checking web ui...
    Info: Starting web ui...
    Info: Starting web ui success!
+   Info: Web UI url: http://127.0.0.1:8080   http://10.172.141.6:8080
+   Info: Start experiment success! The experiment id is LrNK4hae, and the restful server post is 51188.
```

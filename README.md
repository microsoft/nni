NNI (Neural Network Intelligence) is a toolkit to help users run automated machine learning (AutoML) experiments. 
The tool dispatches and runs trial jobs generated by tuning algorithms to search the best neural architecture and/or hyper-parameters in different environments like local machine, remote servers and cloud.

## **Who should consider using NNI**
* Those who want to try different AutoML algorithms in their training code (model) at their local machine.
* Those who want to run AutoML trial jobs in different environments to speed up search (e.g. remote servers and cloud).
* Researchers and data scientists who want to implement their own AutoML algorithms and compare it with other algorithms.
* ML Platform owners who want to support AutoML in their platform.

## **Install & Verify**

**pip install** 
* We only support Linux in current stage, Ubuntu 16.04 or higher are tested and supported. Simply run the following `pip install` in an environment that has `python >= 3.5`, `git` and `wget`.
```
python3 -m pip install -v --user git+https://github.com/Microsoft/nni.git@v0.2
source ~/.bashrc
```

**verify install**
* The following example is an experiment built on TensorFlow, make sure you have `TensorFlow installed` before running it.
```bash
    nnictl create --config ~/nni/examples/trials/mnist/config.yml
```

* Wait for the message `Info: Start experiment success!` in the command line. This message indicates that your experiment has been successfully started. You can explore the experiment using the `Web UI url`.
```diff
    Info: Checking experiment...
    ...
    Info: Starting experiment...
    Info: Checking web ui...
    Info: Starting web ui...
    Info: Starting web ui success!
+   Info: Web UI url: http://yourlocalhost:8080   http://youripaddress:8080
+   Info: Start experiment success! The experiment id is LrNK4hae, and the restful server post is 51188.
```

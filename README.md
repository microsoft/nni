NNI (Neural Network Intelligence) is a toolkit to help users run automated machine learning (AutoML) experiments. 
The tool dispatches and runs trial jobs generated by tuning algorithms to search the best neural architecture and/or hyper-parameters in different environments like local machine, remote servers and cloud.

## **Who should consider using NNI**
* Those who want to try different AutoML algorithms in their training code (model) at their local machine.
* Those who want to run AutoML trial jobs in different environments to speed up search (e.g. remote servers and cloud).
* Researchers and data scientists who want to implement their own AutoML algorithms and compare it with other algorithms.
* ML Platform owners who want to support AutoML in their platform.

## **Install & Verify**

**Install through pip** 	
* We support Linux and MacOS in current stage, Ubuntu 16.04 or higher, along with MacOS 10.14.1 are tested and supported. Simply run the following `pip install` in an environment that has `python >= 3.5`.	
```bash	
    python3 -m pip install --user --upgrade nni
```
Note: If you are in docker container (as root), please remove `--user` from the installation command.

**Install through source code**
* We support Linux (Ubuntu 16.04 or higher), MacOS (10.14.1) in our current stage. 
* Run the following commands in an environment that has `python >= 3.5`, `git` and `wget`.
```bash	
    git clone -b v0.4 https://github.com/Microsoft/nni.git
    cd nni	
    source install.sh	
```

For the system requirements of NNI, please refer to [Install NNI](docs/Installation.md)

**Verify install**	

The following example is an experiment built on TensorFlow. Make sure you have **TensorFlow installed** before running it.	
* Download the examples via clone the source code.	
```bash	
    git clone -b v0.4 https://github.com/Microsoft/nni.git
```
* Run the mnist example.
```bash
    nnictl create --config nni/examples/trials/mnist/config.yml
```

* Wait for the message `INFO: Successfully started experiment!` in the command line. This message indicates that your experiment has been successfully started. You can explore the experiment using the `Web UI url`.
```
INFO: Starting restful server...
INFO: Successfully started Restful server!
INFO: Setting local config...
INFO: Successfully set local config!
INFO: Starting experiment...

         commands                       description
1. nnictl experiment show        show the information of experiments
2. nnictl trial ls               list all of trial jobs
3. nnictl log stderr             show stderr log content
4. nnictl log stdout             show stdout log content
5. nnictl stop                   stop an experiment
6. nnictl trial kill             kill a trial job by id
7. nnictl --help                 get help information about nnictl

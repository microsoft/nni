 **Run DARTS in NNI**	
 ===	

 We are OccamRazerTeam from Microscoft Student Club. During the poject, we turn
 DARTS into one of NNI's tuners. That using gradient descent to search the architecture
 turns discrete problems into a continuous ones is its major advantage.
 Darts successfuly improves three orders of magnitudes in speed, compared to previous methods.

 Our teams' project "DARTS for nni" is in this [repo](https://github.com/microsoft/nni)

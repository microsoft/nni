Searching on DARTS search space
===============================

In this tutorial, we demonstrate how to search on the famous model space proposed in `DARTS <https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.09055>`__.

Through this process, you will learn:

* How to use the built-in model spaces from NNI's model space hub.
* How to use one-shot exploration strategies to explore a model space.
* How to customize evaluators to achieve the best performance.

In the end, we get a strong-performing model on CIFAR-10 dataset, which achieves xx.xx% accuracy.

Use the model space
